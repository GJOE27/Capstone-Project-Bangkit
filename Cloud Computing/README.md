Flask Python server is used to processes images for machine learning using TensorFlow. Python is used to develop app features and the Firebase Admin SDK is used for private API authentication. The Flask server, dependency requirements, and the .h5 model are then dockerized and pushed to the Google Container Registry. Afterward, it is deployed to Cloud Run to handle all the API endpoints. The Android application can then use the private API by authenticating using Firebase Auth to post and get data, storing user data in the Firestore database, and storing user images in Cloud Storage. Additionally, we can use monitoring tools to track and analyze our app's performance.
